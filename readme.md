# Introduction

## Welcome to Benfa NFT!
Official Benfa Netwoek:Whitepaper, last updated January 2022, all contents are subject to change.

**Benfa** combines DAO & NFT in a single platform, a hybrid platform where both the DAO protocol and Non-Fungible Tokens can be integrated which creates another level of user experience. This combination in protocols enables  NFT to provide a marketplace consisting of Market Explorer, Cross-Chain & Cross-NFT Stores, NFT Creators, and Metaverse Gamification.

### Points
Creating the Benfa multiverse, which combines a series of the crypto gallery in different settings and virtual worlds using the Play-to-Earn mechanism, provides an opportunity for players to possess their own items as NFT and let to know more about blockchain technology and decentralized apps in an entertaining way. 

## What is an NFT Marketplace?
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have quickly become one of the most explosive crypto trends since 2020, with increasingly more cryptocurrency holders and traditional investors seeking to own and speculate on these unique blockchain-based assets. NFTs are virtual tokens that represent ownership of something inherently distinct whether it be a physical or digital item, such as artwork, a soundtrack, a collectible, an in-game item or real estate. Unlike regular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or fiat money like the U.S dollar (US$), these digital assets cannot be mutually exchanged for one another because each token has a specific value based on its unique traits and attributes.
NFT marketplaces are platforms where NFTs can be stored, displayed, traded and in some cases minted (created). These marketplaces are to NFTs what Amazon or eBay are to goods. In order to access and use these types of marketplaces, a crypto wallet is needed (MetaMask, Token Pocket, Wallet Connect) and users are prompt to connect their wallet by extension or DApps.

## Spaces & Tokenomics
Benfa NFT Marketplace emphasizes digital artworks, artists’ collections, gaming items, physical products especially those that are jewelry-related, precious stones, and many more. Apart from that, the NFT Creation function enables users to create their very own NFT easily with the interconnected BEP-721 & BEP-1155, which means that new users who do not own NFTs previously, will be able to have their very own unique, illustrative, creative, exclusive work of art to turn into a digital asset.

Why mint your design as an NFT?
Have you ever created the painting, 2D, 3D, Illustrations, pixel art, logotypes, and motion designs unique and special only to see it replicated without any credit given to you, the creator? How much longer will creatives go overlooked and under-appreciated? Well, with NFTs, not much longer.
What are NFT Artworks?
NFT is one of the most popular acronyms on the internet and in the world of decentralized finance. It stands for Non-fungible Token. A fungible token can be replicated and can be exchanged for another of similar value. For example, an $100 note can be exchanged for two $50 notes or five $20 notes. You cannot similarly exchange NFTs. Since it works with blockchain, proof of ownership and legitimacy can be assured, and though it can be replicated, there can only be one legitimate copy. The blockchain also allows the public and prospective buyers to see current owners, the list of past owners, and dates of transfers, and also, you can trace it to the original creator.
How do NFT designs and art?
Pretty much anything digital can be sold as an NFT. Think artworks, paintings, pictures, screenshots, drawings, GIFs, and memes. To start selling NFT artworks, there is a list of things you should do.
Create a digital artwork: Start by creating your unique pieces. Create your 2D, 3D arts, pixel arts, logotypes, brandmark and illustrations, designs, capture that beautiful sight, just get creative.

What do NFT artworks aim to solve?
NFTs are popular because it, among others, looks to solve two key issues for creatives.
Fraud: we have borne witness to several thefts of physical arts, with iconic pieces carted off from museums and art galleries. Off-chain digital artworks are plagued with plagiarisms and thefts also. NFTs aim to solve these by authenticity. placing records of ownership and dates of transfer on the blockchain creates more authenticity. Records on the blockchain cannot be modified or tampered with, hence reducing fraud on digital artwork.
Misattribution of work: with NFTs, ownership of work can be duly accorded to the original creator. No more will a creative go unnoticed or bypassed while his work is accorded to another person.
The NFT market is still young and growing. Beeple’s sale of artwork for $70 million has done a lot in opening many people’s eyes to the possibilities in NFTs. BENFA plans to do even more for you. Tokenize your artworks with us for as little as $1 today.

## Photography NFT
Photography NFT Marketplace
Create your first photo NFT with the NFT marketplace for photographers. Mint photos directly, the platform works with BSC blockchain. With BENFAs, you are getting control over your NFTs, with no middle man cutting your sales. Create, Buy, Sell and Earn with your photography NFTs.

What are NFT photos?
Non-fungible tokens are out to change the status quo for good, and the photography market is not left out. Photography as an NFT checks all reasonable marks — verifies ownership, creates uniqueness, and rewards creators.
How it works

The emergence of NFTs is disrupting the way we view photography and its storage. Physical pictures were the trend a few years ago. Anybody could take pictures of your hardcopy pictures and use them anywhere they want, but you still have ownership of the picture. As the world moved digital, ownership of pictures became more disputable. Original owners received little or no credits for the pictures they either took or owned. NFTs look to solve that problem. Because they are integrated into blockchains, authenticity and openness are assured. So no matter how many times people love your pictures and screenshot them, you still have the ownership and transferable right to the picture.
What does it aim to solve?

Since most pictures are digital or can be scanned into digital form, it is easy for photographers to make money and gain due recognition for their art. And the intriguing part is that while the buyer has the ownership right, the photographer still enjoys copyright and reproduction rights. For instance, Kate Woodman sold her digital image called “Always Coca-Cola” for a little over $20,000. She still owns the right to license the pictures and use them on her social media and can still earn some percentage of royalty when her picture changes hands. An added benefit of photographers going into NFTs is if they have a huge following with a keen liking for their works.
How to tokenize your photographs as an NFT

Tokenizing your photographs or minting follows a straightforward process. The first thing to do is to decide on which photograph you would like to sell. Then you choose which platform you want to sell on. With BENFA, you can mint your photos Directly on your wallet.

The crypto-collectibles market has been a wildfire for the past few months, and we have worked (and are still working) tenaciously to curate and make available the very best of them every available in a simple marketplace. Here’s a little primer for the uninitiated.
What are Crypto Collectibles?
By now, you are probably familiar with the concept of collectibles — prized possessions sought for by collectors. Crypto collectibles are unique items minted on blockchain as non-fungible tokens for anyone to acquire. They are usually limited, and they sell for substantial amounts mostly due to blockchain’s tech that makes them unique and scarce, and humans understand scarcity.
Categories of Crypto Collectibles
Collectibles are items of value that can be sought for and acquired by collectors. Collectors can be anyone, from traders looking for short-term gains to crypto magnates that love collecting stuff. The categories include but are not limited to art, music, clips, sport, and games.
1. Game collectibles
The collectibles market has given the online gaming industry a new (and better) form. Players can now buy game items — weapons, avatar clothing, and other accessories to complete missions or sell to other users for profit. Some virtual games allow users to acquire pieces of land and build houses, casinos, etc., on them, all of which can be sold to other users.
2. Art collectibles
By now, almost everyone is familiar with tokenized artworks and how to mint and collect them seamlessly, thanks to BENFA. Paintings, photographs, and even memes and doodles can now be tokenized and sold on marketplaces.
3. Sports collectibles
Sports collectibles such as kits and accessories, trading cards, and video clips of incredible moments can be acquired and sold on NFT marketplaces.
4. Others
As we earlier mentioned, numerous things can pass as a collectible and be tokenized on the blockchain. That old watch passed to you from your great granny? Check. The autographed chessboard you won years back? Check. So long as they are deemed valuable enough to be acquired, you are probably good to go.
How do Collectibles work?
Crypto collectibles are non-fungible tokens and can be minted on NFT marketplaces. NFT marketplaces are platforms built on a blockchain (usually Binance Smart Chain or Ethereum) to seamlessly create and trade with other users. BENFA is the leading marketplace on Binance Smart Chain for the right reasons: cheap fees, fast transactions, and a large, active community. non-fungible tokens created on the platform are represented as BEP-721 or BEP-1155 tokens and can be sent to any user within Binance Smart Chain.
What do Collectibles Aim to Solve?
Each category of crypto-collectibles offers plenty of benefits, including independence, ease, and of course, liquidity. Sports collectibles, for example, allows fans to connect with their idols directly, game collectibles allow gamers to play and trade and unexposed artists get to connect with potential buyers and sell their works easily,

## Video NFT
Video NFT Marketplace
Create your first video as an NFT with an NFT marketplace for video makers. Create NFT video and motion video directly, the platform works with BSC blockchain and allows you to create an NFT on-chain. With BENFA, you are getting control over your NFTs, with no middle man cutting your sales. Create, Buy, Selland Earn with your mp4 video NFTs.

Sell video as an NFT?

Just a few cases we happened to hear recently in Miami-based art collector Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile spent almost $67,000 on a 10-second video artwork. It wasn’t long since he decided to sell it as the NFT for… $6.6 million.
The video is really a rarity – there are few other videos that could compete with this one in virality. Recently we learned that it was sold as the NFT for $760,999. Therefore, it is no longer on YouTube.
Do you have memorable moments captured on video? How about you make money off it? NBA top Shots recently sold a video of LeBron James’ dunk for $387k. Beeple’s Everyday- The first 5000 days, a 10-second video sold for $69.3 million. If anything, this shows demand for NFT videos, and though the market is still young and thriving, you can make some decent cash off it.
What passes as video NFTs?
While it is improbable to put up a 3-hour long movie as an NFT for now, due to size limits, the truth is that you don’t need that much length and size. Do you have motion videos, short video clips, or animation? If yes, they are perfect as video NFTs.
Why tokenize your video as an NFT?
Asides from NFT’s inherent money-making potential for content creators, Some qualities tip the advantage to NFTs compared to off-chain video storage and distribution. These include:
1. Trustlessness
Tokenization is done via smart contracts in a blockchain. Your animations, clips, and motion designs as NFTs can be stored and sold quicker and without the help of a middle man.
2. Immutability
Anything recorded on a blockchain is immutable. It cannot be modified, altered, changed, or faked.
3. Transparency
You can always track your NFT’s transaction history, origin, issuance date, and the prices it was bought or sold over time, removing the possibilities of fraud in the system.
Royalty on future sales
As expected, you keep earning from your NFT. And while tokenizing might confer anonymity of buyers, smart contracts run all transactions — you will always get a cut on secondary sales of your NFT.
How to create video NFTS
The first thing to do is select the platform you would like to use to mint your Video NFT — BENFA provides the best platform for all your animations, skits, clips, and motion designs as NFTs. We are cheap, fast, and rewarding.
Upload your video in mp4 format and the cover you want to use and fill in the necessary details (title of the video, name of creator, description, etc.)
Make necessary payments: All NFT platforms require traders to pay for the computing energy, called gas fees, to process transactions. While others can charge as much as $500 to mint NFTs, you can create video NFTs Directly on a blockchain!
Click on Create. After a few seconds, your Video NFT will be listed in the marketplace for potential buyers.

With the insane prices artists are selling NFTs for and the increased adoption rate, it is reasonable to say we’re still in the early days. In the coming months, we will see a flood of artists scrimmaging to get their videos online. You now know better, so you should take the shot at tokenizing your videos.

## Music NFT
Create your first music NFTs with the NFT market for musicians. Create music and music videos directly, the platform works with BSC blockchain and supports mp4. With BENFA, you are getting control over your NFTs, with no middle man cutting your sales. Create, Buy, Sell and Earn with your music NFTs.


What is music and how do I create my own music NFT
The music industry has seen many transformations over the years. From records, tapes, compact cassettes, track tapes, and compact discs in the 20th century to downloadable streaming platforms (DSPs) since the early 2000s, the art of listening to music has numerous shapes. Now, the music industry is hinged on DSPs, and for all the ease accessibility and low-cost benefits for listeners, artists still do not profit as much. Most artists still do not earn enough from their music, with the most revenue from tours, merch sales, and partnerships (TVs, video games, and radio stations). This begs the question: might we be due for another upgrade? Well, we believe so, and this is where NFTs and BENFA come into play.
How do Music NFTs work?
NFTs are unique assets stored and tradable on a blockchain. They are, immutable, scarce, and publicly verifiable. In the music world, artists get to sell limited digital content to their fans who pay via crypto. You can now produce any music content that cannot be counterfeited.
What does it aim to solve?
While there are no set frameworks for the partnership, there are a couple of ways top artists have used NFTs that upcoming ones can take a cue from. These include:
1. Album releases
The popular American musician, 3LAU, sold off his tokenized album in February for more than $11 million. Although this sale volume might be an outlier, other artists can take a cue from the move. Limited copies of your album can be sold on-chain, creating exclusive content in a fanciful way. What’s more, artists earn a cut on every secondary sale of the NFTs.
2. Beat Selling
Producers can now sell beats directly to buyers as music NFTs. Thanks to NFTs’ immutability, end-users purchase these beats on-chain and use seamlessly or hold them for profit on resales. Music producers get to earn a royalty on every resale.
3. Merch Sales
Merch, both virtual and physical, can be brought on-chain. Anyone can buy them and resell them. And as usual, artists get a cut on all secondary sales.
4. Stock-type distribution layout
Although untested, this is another way NFTs can benefit the music industry. Imagine selling 20% of rights to your upcoming album as NFTs. This means that asides from on-chain revenue, fans holding the NFTs get to earn a cut from the off-chain revenue generated from your music, such as streaming, TV partnerships, and merch sales. Think of it as a tokenized stock certificate that grants ownership rights of the album. This way, you grow an ecosystem around your work, profiting yourself and loyal fans alike. What’re more, holders gain access to exclusive features such as front-table rows, special concerts, listening parties, etc.


Upsides
1. Artists get to build an active community.
Artists themselves become a platform. NFTs allow artists, especially upcoming ones, to create an ecosystem that allows genuine fans to buy into their market.
2. Lowers the barrier to entry.
NFT gives all the power to creators. Anyone upcoming artiste can do their stuff on-chain, making them more independent and freeing them from unfavorable deals from record labels. Also, artists won’t need to load up to centralized streaming platforms hoping to get enough streamers to generate substantial revenue.
3. Fast-tracks adoption
A positive NFT-fueled change in the music market can upstage crypto adoption at large.
Bottom line
Although the NFT space is relatively new and how labels and music industry techs, and companies level up is not yet known. What is clear, however, is that they hold promise.
BENFA, among other things, aims to connect artists to their genuine fans by providing a cheap NFT platform for music. Join in early and create your music NFTs with us.
